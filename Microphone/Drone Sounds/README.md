Drone Sound and Maneuver Classification
This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning course. It focuses on two key areas:

Drone Sound Classification:

Classifies audio signals to identify whether the sound originates from a drone.
Utilizes machine learning techniques to distinguish drone sounds from other environmental noises.

Drone Maneuver Classification:

Analyzes drone movement patterns to classify different maneuvers (forward,right,left,backward).
